# forest - a forest fire simulator written in C


`forest` is a small C project that I wrote for a high performance computing class in 2013.
It simulates forest fires using a cellular automata algorithm.

## Features

 * works with arbitrary grid sizes, as long as they are divisible by 8
 * multiple output modes:
   * PNG imageset (convertible to a movie with a makefile command)
   * console output (driven by ncurses)
   * null output (for benchmarking)
   * checksum output (for debugging and verification)
 * supports multithreading and parallelisation through OpenMP and MPI

A (low quality, sorry) video of `forest` in action can be found [here](http://youtu.be/h70mjqcDA7k).

## Requirements

### Mandatory

 * GCC and make (*build-essentials* package on ubuntu)

### Optional

 * OpenMP and MPI (if you want to use parallelisation)
 * Latex (*texlive-latex-base* and *texlive-latex-extra* packages on ubuntu) for viewing the Latex documentation
 * ffmpeg (or avconv/libav, depending on your distribution) for rendering PNG imagesets into h264 movies


## Installation and Usage

Compile with `make`, which will create a binary called `forest` in the current directory.
the included makefile has several options:

 * `make omp` - compiles `forest` with OpenMP support
 * `make mpi-moss` - compiles `forest` with MPI support, using the `mpicc` binary.
 * `make mpi-savanna` - compiles `forest` with MPI support, using the `mpiicc` binary.
 * `make movie` - processes the PNG images found in the `out/` folder into a mp4 movie encoded with x264, using either `avconv` or `ffmpeg`, depending on your distribution.
 * `make lossmovie` - as above, but creates a lossless movie file (much larger size, but no loss of information).
 * `make clean` - removes all temporary files, compiled binaries, imagesets, and movie files.

once compiled, run the `forest` binary like so:

`./forest dimensionX dimensionY output simlength`

`dimensionX` and `dimensionY` must both be divisible by 8.

`output` should be one of 'png' 'ncurses' 'null' 'verify' 'log'.

`simlength` should be greater than 1.

## Development Notes and Documentation

Latex documentation is included in the "tex" folder. run `make report-3` to compile.
