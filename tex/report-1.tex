\begin{abstract}
This report introduces the concept of modelling forest fires with cellular
automata, and discusses an implementation of said model.
\end{abstract}

\section{The Forest-Fire Model}

The Forest-Fire model is a cellular automaton-based model of a wild fire
spreading through a forest of trees or other plants. The model has a few
variants but typically follows these rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item An empty cell becomes a tree with probability p.
\item A tree becomes a burning tree with probability f.
\item A tree becomes a burning tree if its neighbours are burning.
\item A burning tree becomes an empty cell.
\end{itemize}
Where variables p and f can be adjusted to produce different patterns.

These simple rules can produce complex patterns and have lead to some research
into the area of modelling forest fires.

\newpage
\section{Algorithm used to represent model}

The algorithm chosen for this report and corresponding program is based on the
rules given above, with a few minor adjustments:

\begin{itemize}
\item Burning trees take l timesteps to become empty.
\item Trees with burning neighbours have probability c to catch fire.
\end{itemize}

This gives provides the simulation with four main variables to adjust - p, f,
l, and c.

\section{Implementation details}

The implementation was chosen to be written in C, based on the student's past
experience with programming. The implementation did not require any complex
programming techniques, although a few key points are worth discussing.

As much of this simulation relies on probabilities, the use of a random number
generator requires some thought. the \texttt{random()} function of the C
standard library was selected due to its ease of use and availability, but as
it is only a pseudo-random number generator, perhaps this could be changed in
later efforts. There are websites that provide "true randomness" based on
atmospheric noise\cite{random}, and perhaps data from this service could be
used and compared against the output of \texttt{random()}.

Exporting the output of the program was done via the use of
libpng\cite{libpng}, which can easily convert 2d arrays into pictures. Sample
code was used from a third party website in order to assist with this
process\cite{png}. After each timestep was completed, the grid of cells was
exported to an image, with pixels being coloured based on their status.

\newpage
\section{Verification of program's output correctness}

The implementation currently uses \texttt{random()} for its random number
generation, and this can be made deterministic by using a predefined seed with
the \textt{srandom()} function. This will be used to compare the results of
later optimisations and multiprocessing techniques.

\newpage
\section{Algorithm's performance while scaling with forest size}

As the algorithm operates on neighbours, which remain constant with an
increasing grid size, performance should scale linearly with number of cells in
the grid.
